### What problem does it solve for various audiences?
Our project will help people who are involved or interested in migration events to get a fresher view and understanding about migration and will provide people a place to explore various cultures, know more about what migration is like, and also build connections with others who may also be interested in learning more about migration.

### Why is the project/product better than the competition?
Our website would definitely be a faster, more convenient and efficient way to display all the related information and let our users explore them, and also it would support a more vivid or dynamic pattern of connection with other people in this digital hub, which leads to a better and more interactive user experience.
